        Draw an object described to you in plain language through code.
        
        
        I used to play with ‘gogos’, plastic figurines that gained a huge amount of popularity in my school playground circa 2008. I remember getting a rare gogo once and feeling on top of the world - how did these tiny plastic pieces captivate us so greatly? It seems inconceivable given the replacements children have today. Nostalgically, I researched them for this project, which reminded me of how colorful and wacky they were, despite being, again, just tiny pieces of plastic. Their faces vary in weird and wonderful expressions, each one with its own personality. 

        I was drawn to one with a sunshine shaped head called ‘Raysun’ that had a yellow head with green rays around it, and blue eyes with a wonky smile. I decided to use it as my inspiration for the drawing because it is colorful, wacky, and abstract.

       I began by drawing the face and coloring it yellow, then changing the background color to a royal blue, to create a striking contrast. I matched the eyes to the blue background and made one eye bigger than the other. I wanted the face/rays to be asymmetrical because the toy itself already had a wonky mouth. I made a happy mistake of putting a (same shade as background) blue rectangle across the face where the mouth was going to be. This led me to put rectangular ‘teeth’ across the ‘open mouth’ rectangle, making the toy more monstrous and striking. Then I added the triangles as abstract rays around its head. This proved more difficult than using circles and squares in terms of the dimensions, but it was useful for thinking about the coordinate system. I layered a few of the triangles on top of eachother (by moving the y coordinate slightly on one of the points) to create the rays.

I stuck to a three color theme and played with the opacity of the object.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
      This was a very loose adaptation of the gogo toy that I chose to draw. I wanted its face to have a Tim Burton ‘Nightmare before Christmas’ kind of aesthetic with the small eyes and wide gap mouth. Through geometric abstraction, I wanted to create a face and body out of 2D primitives, and I like the eccentricity of the character and its asymmetry.

      If I were to draw it again, I would try to make the triangles more equidistant and symmetrical so that the rays formed a crown on its head. I like the abstraction, but I think it would have been more challenging to get the dimensions accurate. I would like to have mapped out the triangles more quickly and efficiently using functions to translate them instead of figuring out their dimensions each time (although this was helpful in getting my bearings with the coordinate system as a newbie to coding!)
