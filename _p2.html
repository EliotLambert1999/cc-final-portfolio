      <h1>Project #2 Interactive Typography</h1>

      <p>
        “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
        technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
        it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
        writing.” <br />
        &#8212; David Reinfurt, A *New* Program for Graphic Designer
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three
        interactive typography sketches. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or
        classes and objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color,
        motion, and interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of
        the word.
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline & Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Feb 12: Pick three words and create nine iterative prototypes in p5.js
        <br />
        Feb 19: Project due, present in class
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Nine iterative prototypes: submit your “Edit” sketch links to Canvas
        <br />
        Finalized sketches: submit your finalized sketches to Canvas as well as
        the Project #2 Glitch page for presentation purposes
      </p>

      <h2>Design Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        (1) Your canvas size should be 600px * 600px
      </p>
