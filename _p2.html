      <h1>Project #2 Interactive Typography</h1>

      <p>
        “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
        technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
        it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
        writing.” <br />
        &#8212; David Reinfurt, A *New* Program for Graphic Designer
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three
        interactive typography sketches. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or
        classes and objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color,
        motion, and interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of
        the word.
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline & Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Feb 12: Pick three words and create nine iterative prototypes in p5.js
        <br />
        Feb 19: Project due, present in class
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Nine iterative prototypes: submit your “Edit” sketch links to Canvas
        <br />
        Finalized sketches: submit your finalized sketches to Canvas as well as
        the Project #2 Glitch page for presentation purposes
      </p>

      <h2>Design Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        (1) Your canvas size should be 600px * 600px <br />
        (2) Use one of the fonts provided in the study guide
      </p>

      <h3>textToPoints() Basics</h3>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/uznuyg8H"></iframe>
      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font/textToPoints"
          >textToPoints()</a
        >
        is a function in p5 that converts text into points on the screen. It’s
        an exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type in new and
        surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you have to use a
        specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your sketches. Here
        are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:
      </p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        Loading Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
        to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
        it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
        on the left side of the editor.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%2012.27.52%20PM.png?v=1580923684682"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now to load the font file, you need to create a global variable to hold
        the font and also load the font file from the preload() function.
        Comparable to setup() and draw(), the preload() function makes sure that
        your font is loaded before the browser loads the rest of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        The preload() function should be placed before the setup() function:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/044b9377547ce54ebf49269a3cd38a9c.js"></script>

      <h4>
        Displaying Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you have your OTF font loaded we can begin to display it. You can
        simply do this by adding this line in your draw():
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1068ef1f0b4c11223f722c6a93b1be31.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now let's intergrate textToPoints() into the progarm and convert the
        pre-exisiting vertices inside our word into points. <br><br>
        To do this, you will need to create a new variable that holds the textToPoints() array:
      </p>
      
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/69247c6c1441f18fc65f419086674b4d.js"></script>
      
      <p>
        There are five parameters inside the textToPoints function here. Let's break it down one by one:

      </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>(1) txt: the first parameter takes a string of text</li>
          <li>(2) x: the second parameter takes a x position value</li>
          <li>(3) y: the third parameter takes a y position value</li>
          <li>(4) fontSize: the forth parameter takes a font size value</li>
          <li>(5) sampleFactor: the fifth parameter is the most important one to understand here. It defines how many points to draw along the text. The defacult value is 0.1, the higher number you enter here results in higher resolution, and lower number results in lower resolution</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Now if you print the variable <i>hiArray</i> in the program, you are going to get a funny message in the p5 console:
      </p>
   <div class="full-width-box">
      <img style ="height:200px" src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.40.37%20PM.png?v=1580928078985">
      </div>
      
  <p>
    Now let's open the web console inside the chrome browser and take a deeper look:
      </p>
         <div class="full-width-box">
      <img style ="height:200px" src ="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.48.19%20PM.png?v=1580928597513">
      </div>
      <p>
        Turns out that our <i>hiArray</i> variable has taken all the vertecies from the text and turned it into an array of objects. Each of these objects inside the array contains a variable x, a variable y, and a variable alpha. Being able to access these variables mean that we can also alter and manipulate them to make interactive type. Amazing! <br/><br/>
        
        We have created a bunch of variables in the program, but we haven't drawn anything on the canvas yet. Since <i>hiArray</i> is simply an array of objects that contain all the x and y values we need to display the text, we can take advantage of that and use a for Loop that pulls all the x and y values out of <i>hiArray</i>:

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/4jQwsJvN"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; use UP / DOWN keys to adjust the number of vertecies.</p>
