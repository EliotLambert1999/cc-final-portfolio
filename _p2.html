      <h1>Project #2 Interactive Typography</h1>

      <p>
        “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
        technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
        it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
        writing.” <br />
        &#8212; David Reinfurt, A *New* Program for Graphic Designer
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three
        interactive typography sketches. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or
        classes and objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color,
        motion, and interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of
        the word.
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline & Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Feb 12: Pick three words and create nine iterative prototypes in p5.js
        <br />
        Feb 19: Project due, present in class
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Nine iterative prototypes: submit your “Edit” sketch links to Canvas
        <br />
        Finalized sketches: submit your finalized sketches to Canvas as well as
        the Project #2 Glitch page for presentation purposes
      </p>

      <h2>Design Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        (1) Your canvas size should be 600px * 600px <br />
        (2) Use one of the fonts provided in the study guide
      </p>

      <h1>Study Guide</h1>

      <h2>Design & Protoyping Phase</h2>

      <h3>textToPoints() Basics</h3>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/uznuyg8H"></iframe>
      <p>
        textToPoints() is a function in p5 that converts text into points on the
        screen. It’s an exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type
        in new and surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you
        have to use a specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your
        sketches. Here are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a
            href="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2Fthumbnails%2Fgrotesk.otf?1580920752167"
            >Copenhagen Grotesk Nova</a
          >
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a
            href="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FMyriadPro-Bold.otf?v=1580920444531"
            >Myriad Pro</a
          >
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a
            href="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FLetterGothicStd.otf?v=1580920712952"
            >Letter Gothic</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        Loading Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
        to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
        it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
        on the left side of the editor.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%2012.27.52%20PM.png?v=1580923684682"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now to load the font file, you need to create a global variable to hold
        the font and also load the font file from the preload() function.
        Comparable to setup() and draw(), the preload() function makes sure that
        your font is loaded before the browser loads the rest of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        The preload() function should be placed before the setup() function:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/044b9377547ce54ebf49269a3cd38a9c.js"></script>
      
            <h4>
        Displaying Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you have your OTF font loaded we can begin to display it. You can simply do this by adding this line in your draw():
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1068ef1f0b4c11223f722c6a93b1be31.js"></script>
      
            <p>
        Now, there are <a href ="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Typography>a number of p5 functions"></a> you can use to tweak the basic look of the font. Such as changing color, stroke, size, alignment, text width. I will let you explore this part on your own.
