        being in a different position and each bowl essentially unique, but it
        is very hard to make these differences *matter* to an audience, and be

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        For Project #3, you will create a generative short story with a clear
        beginning, middle, and end. Your goal is to make a highly re-readable
        story that would make your readers (me and your peers) want to re-read
        it over and over again. Your story should be at least 750 words
        (equivalent to 1.5 pages). Your choice of words, layout, and interaction
        should thoughtfully reflect on the structure and greater meaning of the
        story.

      <div id="basic"><h2>Working with Local Data</h2></div>

      <h3>
        Loading & Displaying Data
      </h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadTable">loadTable()</a>
        is a p5 function that reads the contents of a CSV file and creates a
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">p5.Table</a> object with
        its values. The CSV file must either be located in the sketch's folder
        or elsewhere online.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.images.fecom-media.com/HE1546624_160911-HOP-ENG-P01.jpg?width=348"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Using loadTable() with a local CSV file, let's try to recreate the
        "sentence flip book" children often use to learn how to construct
        sentences. First, open your desktop spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel) or
        Google spreadsheet, and let's create a couple possible sentences for the
        flip book. In the example below I'm using a name, a verb, and a food
        item to construct every sentence. Keep in mind that these sentences must
        follow the rules of modular design, so that different combinations of
        the words would still make out logical sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you're done with that, download the spreadsheet as a CSV file, and
        upload it to your p5 sketch folder. When you click on the CSV file
        inside the p5 editor, you should see something like this:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-26%20at%201.25.08%20AM.png?v=1582698317988"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        If you look carefully, you might figure out that every new line creates
        a new row, and every comma creates a new column. You can edit your CSV
        file inside the editor if you decide that something needs to change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Great! Now let's load the table into the sketch! Just like loading any
        other files in p5, you need to load the CSV file using
        <i>function preload()</i>. Also, inside the p5.Table object, there are a
        couple methods you should know about in order to properly load and
        display the data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getString"
            >getString(row, column)</a
          >: retrieves a String value from the Table's specified row and column.
          For example, <i>getString(0,0)</i> will retrieve the word "Anshuman",
          and <i>getString(3,2)</i> will show "dumplings"
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getColumnCount"
            >getColumnCount()</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getRowCount"
            >getRowCount()</a
          >: returns the total number of columns or rows in a Table. It's used
          in a similar way as array.length
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/hb73hbbK"></iframe>
        <p>&#8627; click to randomize sentence</p>

        <p>
          In this example, I have used <i>random()</i> to generate three
          different row numbers within the range of <i>getRowCount()</i> at the
          start of the sketch as well as when everytime mouse is pressed. And I
          use <i>text()</i> three times to load the possible sentences
          individually:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/aacbce3f23bcddff8b82b8380c7987e5.js"></script>
      </div>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/hb73hbbK"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        So while you're trying this out on your own, you might have noticed that
        a couple lines are being repeated a couple different times to do similar
        things. You could try to combine them into for Loops to write less lines
        of code. However, you'd need to turn your <i>row1</i>, <i>row2</i>, and
        <i>row3</i> variables into a <i>row[]</i> array in order to load them
        properly. Here's the
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/n_1zbjwh"
          >optimized version</a
        >
        of the code above.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">many other methods</a>
        you could use under p5.Table that goes beyond what has been mentioned
        above. Take a look at them to get a sense of what's possible.

      <div id="external"><h2>Working with External Data</h2></div>

      <p>
        Working with external data is a huge topic. There are endless amount of
        data on the internet we could possibly use to draw our sketches and the
        topic of your story could really determines what kind of online data you
        would be looking for.
      </p>
      <h2>
        RiTa.js
      </h2>
      <p>
        RiTa.js is a powerful external JavaScript library that is made for creating
        digital literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step is to load RiTa.js in the p5 editor. Visit
        <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/rita"
          >https://cdnjs.com/libraries/rita</a
        >
        and copy the URL for the version of RiTa.js you'd like to use for the
        sketch. You might notice that the page is hosted by
        <a href="https://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs</a>, this is an open-source,
        community-driven project that hosts all the popular libraries online so
        that you do not need to manually download them to your sketch folder.
        You can learn more about CDN
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/">here</a
        >.

        underneath the <i>&lt;head&gt;</i> tag let's add this line:
