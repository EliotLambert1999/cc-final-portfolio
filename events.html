          Theorizing the Web is an inter- and non-disciplinary annual conference
          that brings together scholars, journalists, artists, activists, and
          technology practitioners to think conceptually and critically about
          the interrelationships between the Web and society. We deeply value
          public engagement, and consider insights from academics,
          non-academics, and non-“tech theorists” alike to be equally valuable.
