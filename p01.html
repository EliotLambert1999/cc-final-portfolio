        I used to play with ‘gogos’, plastic figurines that gained a huge amount of popularity in my school playground circa 2008. I remember getting a rare gogo once and feeling on top of the world - how did these tiny plastic pieces captivate us so greatly? It seems inconceivable given the replacements children have today. Nostalgically, I researched them for this project, and reminded myself of how colorful and wacky they were, despite being, again, just tiny pieces of plastic. Their faces vary in weird and wacky expressions, each one with its own personality. 

        I was drawn to one with a sunshine shaped head called ‘Raysun’ that had a yellow head with green rays around it, and blue eyes with a wonky smile. I decided to use it as my inspiration for the drawing because it is colorful, wacky, and abstract.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
       I began by drawing the face and coloring it yellow, then changing the background color to a royal blue, to create a striking contrast. I matched the eyes to the blue background and made one eye bigger than the other. I wanted the face/rays to be asymmetrical because the toy itself already had a wonky mouth. I made a happy mistake of putting a (same shade as background) blue rectangle across the face where the mouth was going to be. This allowed me to put rectangular ‘teeth’ across the ‘open mouth’ rectangle, making the toy more monstrous and striking. Then I added the triangles as abstract rays around its head. This proved more difficult than using circles and squares in terms of the dimensions, but it was useful to draw out a graph and think about the coordinate system. I layered a few of the triangles on top of eachother (by moving the y coordinate slightly on one of the points) to create the rays.
