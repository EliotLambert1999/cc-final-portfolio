      I was inspired by popularized phrases from the reality TV show 'Love Island' to create a form generator. 'Don't put your eggs in one basket' is repeated like a spiritual mantra on the show, and was my inspiration for this piece. These phrases have become universal, yet when decontextualized from the bizarre world of reality TV and heternormative dating, they seem complicately arbitrary in describing romance. To explore this, I randomized the order of the phrases in the middle of the canvas that are delivered everytime the user presses the mouse. I defined the index and randomized it I wanted the oval shapes lined down the middle to resemble both eggs and human faces so that they could switch from one the other when toggled over with a mouse, to emphasise the forms morphing into eachother. The faces are silly and playful and seek to further parody the sentences. I made use of stroke to outline the bold text and eyes, to make the saturated colours pop.
