      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
      <p>
      I was inspired by popularized phrases from the reality TV show 'Love Island' to create a form generator, switching between egg-shaped black holes and cheeky emoji-like faces. I started thinking about Love Island’s most iconic/repeated phrases, and came up with: "HE'S NOT MY TYPE ON PAPER", "DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET", "DON'T MUG ME OFF!", "MY HEAD'S BEEN TURNED","YOU ARE WELL FIT".

      ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ has become a spiritual mantra for both Love Island followers and many heterosexual daters - and I am curious about how arbitrary these types of phrases sound when decontextualized from the bizarre world of reality TV.

      I wanted to explore that arbitrariness through randomizing the order of the five phrases (by defining the index then randomizing the ordering of it). The phrase changes every time the mouse is clicked by the user.
      This is the code that I used : function mousePressed() { index = int(random(0, texts.length))
     
      <br>
        
      Next, I thought about the form - I wanted oval shapes to line up symmetrically down the middle, resembling both eggs and human faces to emphasize the forms morphing into each other. After plotting out the dimensions of the ellipses, I defined the left and right boundary so that I could define the mouseX variable ("let leftBoundary = 100; let rightBoundary = 300;") The form I chose to experiment with wasn’t exactly complex - but it helped me to explore random,mouseX/Y,and mousepressed functions as a first-time coder.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
      I enjoy the playfulness of the piece - the saturated colors and stroke weight outlining the text and eyes acts as a homage to the saturation of pop culture and reality TV - in a nostalgic yet slightly disturbing way. If I were to develop this, I would randomize the position of the text so that there was more erratic and randomized movement, and make each face appear at a different hovering time to emphasize their varied expressions.
