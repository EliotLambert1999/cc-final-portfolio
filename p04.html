      <h1>Description</h1>

<p>
   
I decided to make my own exquisite corpse - I was excited to draw my own because my artistic style is quite experimental and collagey, so I wanted to explore what I could do with exploring human and non-human forms. I grew up playing ‘consequences’, and have always been impressed by how the three forms combined are so much more visually interesting together than apart, especially because the game has a short time limit and relies on spontaneous creativity over meticulous craft.

This is the sketch that I drew for the first part of the assignment:

 I was inspired by Greek mythology when drawing my sketch - I recreated Medusa’s hair and combined it with the singular eye of Cerberus. Greek mythology has always inspired me both in a literary and aesthetic sense  - everyone knows the one-eyed monster and the woman with snakes in her hair who turns victims to stone - they are monstrous and transgressive. I used the eye from Dziga Vertov’s ‘A Man with a Movie Camera’ as Medusa/Cerburus’s eye because it represents ‘kino eye’ - a radical anti-bourgeois movement in film - and in my opinion the act of cutting up and reassembling, even if just for experimentation - is political. The second section of the figure I sketched in illustrator and replicated an abstract fish/bird with a red ribcage. The third section was an x-ray image of a ballerina's feet - inspired by The Black Swan and its harrowing depiction of the physical and psychological pain of being a ballerina. I also wanted to include xray because it builds more texture.

      I was happy with my sketch, so I decided to replicate it in p5js. I imported the top section (the head) into my sketch and changed its measurements to fit. For the next section, I wanted to create abstract lungs and a spine to represent the body. I used a function to set out the ‘ribs’ - the lines - to speed up the process of mapping the dimensions. I represented the lungs with two ellipses and made only half of the ribs transparent. I drew a spine in illustrator to carry on the sketchy/collagey theme - I didn’t want the middle part to look too solid/structured. Finally, I added the ballet feet x-ray (a different version that I widened to make look less human and more paw-like. I tripled the feet to create a glitchy effect and flipped the right foot to make it mirror the left. As a finishing touch, I wrote ‘The theater of the absurd’(with imported font) underneath the figure’s lungs, because I am a big fan of director David Lynch who once described life as this - I think he’s right and it felt fitting to add to this piece.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p>
      I am content with the final look of the figure - I think this assignment really suited my aesthetic and I enjoyed thinking about mixed media/photomontage/surrealism when doing it, as well as importing images into my sketch for the first time.  If I was to develop this sketch, I would add motion to make one of the body parts spin around - maybe the feet could swing from side to side in a slightly creepy dance? The assignment got me thinking about functions when I had to repeat many lines to form the figure’s rib cage, and it saved me time not having to map out each dimension. I also got more familiar with importing images from Adobe illustrator and external fonts.
