      <h1>Description</h1>
I decided to make my own exquisite corpse - I was excited to draw my own because my artistic style is quite experimental and collagey, so I wanted to explore what I could do with exploring human and non-human forms. I grew up playing ‘consequences’, and have always been impressed by how the three forms combined are so much more visually interesting together than apart, especially because the game has a short time limit and relies on spontaneous creativity over meticulous craft.

This is the sketch that I drew for the first part of the assignment:

 I was inspired by Greek mythology when drawing my sketch - I recreated Medusa’s hair and combined it with the singular eye of Cerberus. Greek mythology has always inspired me both in a literary and aesthetic sense  - everyone knows the one-eyed monster and the woman with snakes in her hair who turns victims to stone - they are monstrous and transgressive. I used the eye from Dziga Vertov’s ‘A Man with a Movie Camera’ as Medusa/Cerburus’s eye because it represents ‘kino eye’ - a radical anti-bourgeois movement in film - and in my opinion the act of cutting up and reassembling, even if just for experimentation - is political. The second section of the figure I sketched in illustrator and replicated an abstract fish/bird with a red ribcage. The third section was an x-ray image of a ballerina's feet - inspired by The Black Swan and its harrowing depiction of the physical and psychological pain of being a ballerina. I also wanted to include xray because it builds more texture.

      I started by visualizing the record, using ellipses and text to design it. I imported a vintage font from online - ‘ vinyl smooth bv’ - to make the record more realistic. I ordered the text in a way that would seem like a record label listing songs. Next, I imported the song ‘Stayin Alive’ into my p5js library. I learned how to add a play/pause button so that the music didn’t immediately start. It was my first time preloading both font and music into the library, which was helpful to learn for future projects. Once I had my static record and music to accompany it, I moved onto the rotation. I made the rotation speed a variable and translated the canvas so that the shapes/text didn’t rotate off the page. I changed the speed to 0.015 to start with, because any higher would make the record spin too quickly.

      I was debating whether to add a digital time clock to the record, with the hours of the day in the middle.  I tested and tried it out, but decided aesthetically that it looked better without numbers, and that a symbol such as a circle looping around the record would be more abstract and interesting. I created this loop by adding an ellipse to the canvas (overlayed on top of the circle I used to make the record base). I changed the dimensions of the ellipse so that it would grow longer every second.

      Overall, I am happy with the progress I made this week, but if I were to develop it, I would add more layers to the piece. I struggled with visualizing the time without numbers/clock hands, and I think if the record sped up and slowed down depending on the time of day (9 to 5 it spins the slowest, whereas 5-9 it spins fast), then the piece would be more effective. Or speeding up the music when the work day ends - essentially any variable that signifies a shift between the two states.  I wanted to do this but struggled with the code, and am determined to crack it for next time, and to develop this project! I would also like to sync up the music to the visuals. Conceptually, I really enjoyed expanding my concept of time, exploring the dissonance between how it is displayed and how it is perceived, learning about crip time and other ways that time can feel subjective and deeply personal. I think code is helpful for visualizing and experiencing that.
