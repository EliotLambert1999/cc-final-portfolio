      <h1>Game Proposal</h1>

<p>
  
        As Halloween is coming up on Tuesday, I thought it would be appropriate to make a game about the scariest thing of all - being ‘ghosted’ on dating apps. According to Logan Ury, Hinge’s Director of Relationship Science, says that 91% of hinge users have been ghosted - meaning they’ve been ignored/left on read. Hinge or other dating apps give prospective daters choice paralysis - how to choose the right person when there are so many to filter through?
I want to explore the phenomenon of ‘ghosting’ on dating apps through a comical/ironic perspective. 

<br>

      <p>


The character navigates a virtual space that represents a dating app. The character’s aim is to secure a date without being ghosted. The character has to collect green texts and avoid red texts - if it collects more than 5 green texts without colliding into a red text, then it wins the game. If it hits a red text, then it automatically loses, and the player has the oppurtunity to play again. The game follows the same structure of doodle jump or another game where you have to collect certain objects and avoid others). The red flags will have higher collision potential to make the game more challenging.
<br>
<br>   

The setbacks/red texts are examples of messages that lead to being ghosted:
<br>
‘Seen last month’
        <br>
‘Sorry my hamster has separation anxiety so I can't text you back tonight’
        <br>
‘U up?’ at 3am’
  <br>
'sorry I never go on my dating apps but my screen time is 10 hours per day'
<br><br>
The advances/green texts are examples of situations/comments that lead to you securing a date: 
<br>
-‘I am not still in love with my ex’
<br>
-‘Let's take the risk of meeting up in real life even if we hate eachother’
<br>
-‘I cry when dogs die in movies and I grew up with sisters so I am emotionally available’
        <br><br>
        
        The red texts and green texts are intentionally tongue-in-cheek - the green texts are parodies of what people idealize in heteronormative dating, even if sometimes they are the bare minimum.
<br><br>

        The final outcome is that if you hit a red text box, you get ghosted and lose the game, commenting on the fickleness of dating culture! You can restart the game by pressing the restart button.

                The main character, which I created on piskel, an online pixel sprite editor, is a non-gender specific pixelated creature with love hearts for eyes. The sprite is a hopeless romantic and is on its journey to find love. I was inspired by the aesthetic of Anna Anthropy's 'Dys4ia' to explore making pixel art, and piskel has a very user friendly interface.

    The character enters a shiny white hallway similar to representations of heaven as a white room. There are dating profiles displayed on every wall - at first I collected them from google images but then I replaced them with DALLE-2 generated images of 'female dating profiles' and 'male dating profiles', for obvious privacy reasons. The results are creepy and absurd - the profiles lack human relatability and stare down at you from the walls. I like the added surrealist element of using AI-generated dating profiles - firstly because of data privacy, but also because it adds a layer of parody to the already semi-ridiculous rituals of heteronormative dating on apps like Hinge and Tinder.
       <br><br>
    The character has to move through the space (using arrow keys) to get to the end of the hallway - and in doing so, securing a date. 
<br><br>
<h1>Middle  </h1>
    <br><br>

      After walking through the entrance hall, the player enters a room that simulates the inside of a phone screen, it is a cold white colour and glowing, with a stream of red and green text bubbles moving towards the player. The red texts move more quickly. The aesthetic is glitchy. If the player collides with a red text, then the screen switches to 'You've Been Ghosted', but if the player collides with 5 green texts, then the screen switches to 'You Haven't Been Ghosted...Yet!'(as visualized in the next section)

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>
      
First, I adapted the game template that we were shown in class for my code. The code had scene switches and a player sprite that moved across scenes through collision detection. I started by coding the landing page. I preloaded an AI generated image from Midjourney that I had got from the prompt “a pixelated room of iphone screens with hinge dating profiles of men and women's faces blurred out on each screen. each face is a different skin color and different gender.” I made this prompt more specific, because the previous results for just ‘dating profiles of men and women’ generated only images of blonde women, and I wanted the faces to reflect more than just that homogenous demographic. 
        <br><br>
        The first scene needed a clear prompt of where to move the player sprite to enter the game, so I made a black rectangle in the middle of the screen with the text ‘enter if you dare’, and coded the sprite so that if it moved up to the halfway point on the canvas, the scene would switch to scene 1. 
        <br><br>

The next scene I coded was the falling text scene, the scene with the core game component. It proved to be the most time consuming to get right, as I wanted to simulate the experience of texting on an iphone. I had to create two classes of red and green text bubbles with differing text arrays depending on if the text messages were red or green flags. Then I had to randomize the position and change the speed of the falling text bubbles, so that the red text bubbles fell faster to make it harder for the sprite to dodge them.
        <br><br>
        Next, I had to define collision detection so that if the sprite collided with the red text bubble class, by entering into its defined parameters, then the scene would switch to the final scene, a black page with text saying ‘you’ve been ghosted!’ and lots of mini ghost emojis scrambling around the page. 

<br><br>
        This was the core code of my game. But after reviewing it a few times, I realized that another scene was necessary, because the game wasn’t long enough, and needed to be more engaging. I wanted to add a final scene in which users could input their own text to write to someone who had ghosted them, but then realized it would be better if that scene came before the falling text scene, so that the text inputted could be added to the red text bubble array, meaning that their text would show up in one of the falling text bubbles. This took a long time to get right, for some reason I had many problems with getting the text to be displayed, even when I could see through the console log that the text was being added to the array each time. I also made the text bubble in this second scene match the text bubbles from the falling text scene, to match the simulated phone aesthetic. Submitting the text adds it to the array/Hinge ether. 
        <br><br>

Finally, I added sound to the game, to contextualize it and make it more jarring/stressful/intriguing. I found a few Hinge adverts on Youtube and mixed extracts from them with extracts from a video that interviews 100 people and asks them if they’ve ever been ghosted. The sound created is a mix of interviewees complaining about being ghosted overlaid by a Hinge Ad claiming that the app is designed to be deleted - an excellent marketing ploy to boast the app’s success rate. This sound plays on the landing page, until the player goes into the text input scene, which triggers an AI-generated voiceover contextualizing your situation as a player stuck in the disappointing world of ghosting - you are told that your dating life is disastrous but that you should be brave and bold and text your date to meet again, which prompts you to input a text to someone. When the scene switches, the sound returns to the original mix from the first scene, then when you eventually lose the game and get ghosted, a slowed down sample from the advert saying ‘hinge, designed to be deleted’, plays ironically.
      The final touch was to change the sprite from a pixelated heart-eyed figure to an AI-generated woman - I wanted to keep the AI-generated imagery theme consistent, and the pixel figure seemed to be out of place.
        <br><br>
        
        <br><br>
      
      
          <h1>Reflection</h1>
      
       <p>
      As you can see, the game evolved a lot from the proposal, as I found ways to make the game less image heavy and more interactive. I am proud of this project, and think that I want to develop it more as it is so topical - everyone loves to talk about dating, romance (or lack thereof), and the alienating experience of online dating during late stage capitalism, which I think this game definitely touches on. I am happy with its absurdity and non-linear structure and aim compared to a typical virtual game. However, I definitely found coding the text input scene challenging, and would like to experiment with that process more to grow confidence in creating and modifying arrays and classes. I want the user to feel like they are actually on their phone, texting that person they have been avoiding, or have always wanted to text. I think the sound really leads the narrative - without it - the player would feel less uneasy or incentivized to avoid the text bubbles. 

<br><br>
         Ideally one day, hundreds and even thousands of text messages could be added to the text arrays, to sustain the biggest Hinge simulation of all time! Although that sounds a bit terrifying, but somewhat comforting in creating solidarity between the masses against the ghosters of this society. Soon come.
