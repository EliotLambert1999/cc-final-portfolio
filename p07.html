      <h1>Game Proposal</h1>

<p>
  
        As Halloween is coming up on Tuesday, I thought it would be appropriate to make a game about the scariest thing of all - being ‘ghosted’ on dating apps. According to Logan Ury, Hinge’s Director of Relationship Science, says that 91% of hinge users have been ghosted - meaning they’ve been ignored/left on read. Hinge or other dating apps give prospective daters choice paralysis - how to choose the right person when there are so many to filter through?
I want to explore the phenomenon of ‘ghosting’ on dating apps through a comical/ironic perspective.

The character navigates a virtual space that represents a dating app. The character’s aim is to secure a date without being ghosted. The character has to collect green texts and avoid red texts - if it collects more than 5 green texts without colliding into a red text, then it wins the game. If it hits a red text, then it automatically loses, and the player has the oppurtunity to play again. The game follows the same structure of doodle jump or another game where you have to collect certain objects and avoid others). The red flags will have higher collision potential to make the game more challenging.
<br>
<br>   

The setbacks/red texts are examples of messages that lead to being ghosted:
<br>
‘Seen last month’
        <br>
‘Sorry my hamster has separation anxiety so I can't text you back tonight’
        <br>
‘U up?’ at 3am’
  <br>
'sorry I never go on my dating apps but my screen time is 10 hours per day'
<br><br>
The advances/green texts are examples of situations/comments that lead to you securing a date: 
<br>
-‘I am not still in love with my ex’
<br>
-‘Let's take the risk of meeting up in real life even if we hate eachother’
<br>
-‘I cry when dogs die in movies and I grew up with sisters so I am emotionally available’
        <br><br>
        
        The red texts and green texts are intentionally tongue-in-cheek - the green texts are parodies of what people idealize in heteronormative dating, even if sometimes they are the bare minimum.
<br><br>

        The final outcome is that you either get ghosted or dont get ghosted...yet, depending on if you are hit with a red text, commenting on the fickleness of dating culture!

                The main character, which I created on piskel, an online pixel sprite editor, is a non-gender specific pixelated creature with love hearts for eyes. The sprite is a hopeless romantic and is on its journey to find love. I was inspired by the aesthetic of Anna Anthropy's 'Dys4ia' to explore making pixel art, and piskel has a very user friendly interface.

    The character enters a shiny white hallway similar to representations of heaven as a white room. There are dating profiles displayed on every wall - at first I collected them from google images but then I replaced them with DALLE-2 generated images of 'female dating profiles' and 'male dating profiles', for obvious privacy reasons. The results are creepy and absurd - the profiles lack human relatability and stare down at you from the walls. I like the added surrealist element of using AI-generated dating profiles - firstly because of data privacy, but also because it adds a layer of parody to the already semi-ridiculous rituals of heteronormative dating on apps like Hinge and Tinder.
       <br><br>
    The character has to move through the space (using arrow keys) to get to the end of the hallway - and in doing so, securing a date. 
<br><br>
<h1>Middle  </h1>
    <br><br>

      After walking through the entrance hall, the player enters a room that simulates the inside of a phone screen, it is a cold white colour and glowing, with a stream of red and green text bubbles moving towards the player. The red texts move more quickly. The aesthetic is glitchy. If the player collides with a red text, then the screen switches to 'You've Been Ghosted', but if the player collides with 5 green texts, then the screen switches to 'You Haven't Been Ghosted...Yet!'(as visualized in the next section)
