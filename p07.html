        As Halloween is coming up on Tuesday, I thought it would be appropriate to make a game about the scariest thing of all - being ‘ghosted’ on dating apps. According to Logan Ury, Hinge’s Director of Relationship Science, says that 91% of hinge users have been ghosted - meaning they’ve been ignored/left on read. Hinge or other dating apps give prospective daters choice paralysis - how to choose the right person when there are so many to filter through?
I want to explore the phenomenon of ‘ghosting’ on dating apps through a comical/ironic perspective.

The character navigates a virtual space that represents a dating app. The character is intending to move through the space without being ghosted. The character’s aim is to secure a date without being ghosted. The character faces setbacks and advances on the way to securing a date.
<br>
<br>   

The setbacks/red flags are examples of messages that lead to being ghosted:
<br>
‘Seen last month’
        <br>
‘Sorry my hamster has separation anxiety so I can't text you back tonight’
        <br>
‘U up?’ at 3am’
  <br>
'sorry I never go on my dating apps but my screen time is 10 hours per day'
<br><br>
The advances/green flags are examples of situations/comments that lead to you securing a date: 
<br>
-‘I am not still in love with my ex’
<br>
-‘Let's take the risk of meeting up in real life even if we hate eachother’
<br>
-‘I cry when dogs die in movies and I grew up with sisters so I am emotionally available’
        <br><br>
        
        The red flags and green flags are intentionally tongue-in-cheek - the green flags are parodies of what people idealize in heteronormative dating, even if sometimes they are the bare minimum.
<br><br>

        The final outcome, regardless of the setbacks/advances you encounter in the game, is that you still get ghosted, commenting on the fickleness of dating culture!

    The character enters a shiny white hallway similar to representations of heaven as a white room. There are dating profiles displayed on every wall - at first I collected them from google images but then I replaced them with DALLE-2 generated images of 'female dating profiles' and 'male dating profiles', for obvious privacy reasons. The results are creepy and absurd - the profiles lack human relatability and stare down at you from the walls. I like the added surrealist element of using AI-generated dating profiles - firstly because of data privacy, but also because it adds a layer of parody to the already semi-ridiculous rituals of heteronormative dating on apps like Hinge and Tinder.
       <br><br>
    The character has to move through the space (using arrow keys) to get to the end of the hallway - and in doing so, securing a date.
