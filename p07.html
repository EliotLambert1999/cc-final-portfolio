        As Halloween is coming up on Tuesday, I thought it would be appropriate to make a game about the scariest thing of all - being ‘ghosted’ on dating apps. According to Logan Ury, Hinge’s Director of Relationship Science, says that 91% of hinge users have been ghosted - meaning they’ve been ignored/left on read. Hinge or other dating apps give single people choice paralysis - how to choose the right person when there are so many to filter through?
I want to explore the phenomenon of ‘ghosting’ on dating apps through a comical/ironic perspective.

        <br><br>
      

The character navigates a virtual space that represents a dating app. The character is intending to move through the space without being ghosted. The character’s aim is to secure a date without being ghosted. The character faces setbacks and advances on the way to securing a date.

The setbacks/red flags are examples of messages that lead to being ghosted:
<br>
‘Seen last week’
        <br>
‘Sorry I’m booked up for the next two weeks’
        <br>
‘U up?’ at 3am’
