    <h1>#1 MODULAR ANIMATION</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to
      mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western cultures
      as early as the beginning of written languages. Create a set number of 2D
      primitive shapes and transform them to compose three different images
      using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes should be added or
      subtracted throughout the transformations. Please don’t use any color
      other than black and white for this assignment. Pay close attention to the
      positive and negative space each transformation creates.
    </p>
