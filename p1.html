    <h1>#1 MODULAR ANIMATION</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to
      mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western cultures
      as early as the beginning of written languages. Create a set number of 2D
      primitive shapes and transform them to compose three different images
      using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes should be added or
      subtracted throughout the transformations. Please don’t use any color
      other than black and white for this assignment. Pay close attention to the
      positive and negative space each transformation creates.
    </p>

    Here, Now, and Waiting is a series of memorial signs that aim to commemorate Jongno, a district in Seoul where young people held street demonstrations and to reflect on the emancipatory time of Jongno. The signs consist of several words made out of Hangeul vowels and consonants – the Korean alphabet – that can be interpreted an aphoristic text, Now, Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What. In order to visualize the flow of time, the letters are attached to clock movements behind the front panel of the sign. In the design outcome, the letters constantly rotate on the front panel constructing and deconstructing the words, Now, Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What. It asks what we are waiting for to come here and now.

Here, Now, and Waiting was exhibited in the 4th International Typography Biennale: Typojanchi 2015 at Culture Station 284 in Seoul, Korea from November 11 to December 12, 2015 and was published in its exhibition catalog in 2015. In addition, it was also published in a typography journal, LetterSeed No.12: City and Typography in December, 2015.
