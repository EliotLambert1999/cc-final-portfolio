      <h1>Project #1 Modular Animation</h1>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to
        mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western
        cultures as early as the beginning of written languages. Create a set
        number of 2D primitive shapes and transform them to compose three
        different images using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes
        should be added or subtracted throughout the transformations. Please
        don’t use any color other than black and white for this assignment. Pay
        close attention to the positive and negative space each transformation
        creates.
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline & Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Jan 29: 15-frame storyboard<br />
        Feb 5: project due, present in class
      </p>

      <h2>Design Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        (1) Use <= 3 colors for the sketch, though you are encouraged to use
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/blendMode">p5 blend mode</a> to
        "mix" additional colors.
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Please submit your sketch to two places: <br />
        (1) Submit your “Edit” sketch link to Canvas Project #1<br />
        (2) Add the “Embed” sketch link to the Project #1 Glitch page
      </p>
  
      <h2>Overview</h2>
  
  <h3>Collective Knowledge-Building</h3>
  <p>
    (1)What are some examples of modular design? Think as widely as possible. 
  </p>

      <h3>Modular Design</h3>

      <h3>Creating keyframe animation in p5.js</h3>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/-uliLUmcU"></iframe>

      <p>
        In p5, we can create simple keyframe animations using the conditional
        statements. In the example sketch above, the ball transitions between
        keyframe A and B, and that is controlled by an if... else if statement:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/3878cd4afcb4649560d1b0a3f976f237.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/-uliLUmcU"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        However, you might find the conditional statements limiting when you
        want to choreograph a more complicated animation. See the example below,
        what if we want the ball to coontinously bounce between A - B - A - C -
        A, and continuosloy drawing an "L" on the screen?
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/6rD8OGH64"></iframe>

      <p>
        This takes a bit of creativity -- when the ellipse returns to A the
        second time, we have to find a way to tell it to go up to C instead of
        back to B. One way to approach this is to create a boolean variable, so
        that an additional true / false condition can let the computer know when
        to go to B and when to go to C under the condition of x == 50. However,
        for this project you will learn how to use the switch statement to solve
        a problem like this.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What is a keyframe?</h3>

      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          style="width:300px; height:180px"
          src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftumult.com%2Fhype%2Fdocumentation%2F2.0%2Fimages%2FanimationKeyframes.png&f=1&nofb=1"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        In both animation and filmmaking, a keyframe shows us the starting or
        ending point of a motion. The idea of keyframe can be traced back to
        landscape photographer Edward Muybridge's photo experiment, which
        <a href="https://mashable.com/2015/12/21/muybridge-motion-studies/"
          >revolutionized the way we understand motion</a
        >.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        In drawn animation a keyframe literally refers to the first frame or the
        last frame of a transition. The position of keyframes on an animation
        timeline has an overpowering effect on how timing and movement is
        experienced.

      <h3>What is Blend Mode?</h3>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/5NhLJj33Y"></iframe>
      <p>MULTIPLY multiplies the colors. The result will always be darker.</p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/qdfjVs0bT"></iframe>
      <p>
        SCREEN is the opposite of MULTIPLY, uses inverse values of the colors.
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/YwwtbKvSo"></iframe>
      <p>
        OVERLAY mixes MULTIPLY and SCREEN by multiplying dark values and
        screening light values.
