    <h1>#1 Modular Animation</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
      Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western cultures as early as the beginning of written languages. 

Create a set number of 2D primitive shapes and transform them to compose three different images using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes should be added or subtracted throughout the transformations. Please donâ€™t use any color other than black and white for this assignment. Pay close attention to the positive and negative space each transformation creates.
