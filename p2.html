      <h1>Project #2 Interactive Typography</h1>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to
        mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western
        cultures as early as the beginning of written languages. Create a set
        number of 2D primitive shapes and transform them to compose three
        different images using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes
        should be added or subtracted throughout the transformations. Please
        don’t use any color other than black and white for this assignment. Pay
        close attention to the positive and negative space each transformation
        creates.

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Please submit your sketch to two places: <br />
        (1) Submit your “Edit” sketch link to Canvas Project #1<br />
        (2) Add the “Embed” sketch link to the Project #1 Glitch page
      </p>
      
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>Setting Up Your Work Environment</h3>
      <p>
        You can make your coding experience a lot smoother and save a lot of
        time by setting up a healthy work environment. For example, when you're
        working with nested for Loop, it's a very good idea to draw and number
        all the grid cells on your canvas as things can get confusing really
        quickly. Here's a
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/ujBIbOWPj">template</a>
        I've created to help you get started. <br />
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/ujBIbOWPj"></iframe>
        <p> In the source code, you'd see that I have created a grid using a
        nested for Loop:
        </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e49a9df08408b9758a2959078ffb4121.js"></script>
        <p>
          By looking at the numbers labeled on each and every cell, I can instruct the program to draw a diagonal line onto row 1, column 1 on the grid by adding <code><b>if(i == 1 && j == 1)</b></code> in the nested for loop. <br>
          
          The <b>const cellnum</b> variable defines the number of
        rows and columns and <b>const g</b> defines the width and height of the
        cells. When you use the template, change the values of these variables to draw a grid based on your own
        design needs.

      Here, Now, and Waiting is a series of memorial signs that aim to
      commemorate Jongno, a district in Seoul where young people held street
      demonstrations and to reflect on the emancipatory time of Jongno. The
      signs consist of several words made out of Hangeul vowels and consonants –
      the Korean alphabet – that can be interpreted an aphoristic text, Now,
      Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What. In order to
      visualize the flow of time, the letters are attached to clock movements
      behind the front panel of the sign. In the design outcome, the letters
      constantly rotate on the front panel constructing and deconstructing the
      words, Now, Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What. It
      asks what we are waiting for to come here and now. Here, Now, and Waiting
      was exhibited in the 4th International Typography Biennale: Typojanchi
      2015 at Culture Station 284 in Seoul, Korea from November 11 to December
      12, 2015 and was published in its exhibition catalog in 2015. In addition,
      it was also published in a typography journal, LetterSeed No.12: City and
      Typography in December, 2015. Installation, Typography, 2015
