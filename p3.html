        “It is very easy to pour 10,000 bowls of plain oatmeal, with each oat
        being in a different position and each bowl essentially unique, but it
        is very hard to make these differences *matter* to an audience, and be
        perceived as truly different in any memorable or thought-provoking way.”

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #3, you will create a generative short story with a clear
        beginning, middle, and end. Your goal is to make a highly re-readable
        story that would make your readers (me and your peers) want to re-read
        it over and over again. Your story should be at least 750 words
        (equivalent to 1.5 pages). Your choice of words, layout, and interaction
        should thoughtfully reflect on the structure and greater meaning of the
        story.

      <h2>Timeline & Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        Feb 26: Submit proposal slideshow for your generative fiction to Canvas. The
        proposal should include an overall description of your story and a narrative
        diagram showing various versions of the story. Address conceptual /
        aesthetic goals as well as technical steps and submit it to canvas
        <br /><br />
        March 4: Complete white-boxed version of the project for peer-reading
        session. Your sketch should generate a story of at least 750 words.
        <br /><br />
        March 11: Project due, present in class
      </p>

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

          >textToPoints()</a
        >
        is a method in p5 that converts text into points on the screen. It’s an
        exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type in new and
        surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you have to use a
        specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your sketches. Here
        are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:

        Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
        to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
        it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
        on the left side of the editor.
